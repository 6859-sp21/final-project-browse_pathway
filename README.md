## Abstract
We present an interactive web tool for visualizing social mobility data in relation to college education, parental income, race, and neighborhood in the United States. This tool explores the technique of “scrollytelling” - storytelling through animation on scroll along with a variety of graph interactivity. It also takes the opportunity to engage the audience to speculate a data point before revealing it, which helps them to better internalize the insights.

## Development process
For the development process, Christabel contributed to the map visualization. Zhixin implemented the scatter plot section.  Yen-Ting created concept design, prototypes and contributed to the paper. As the dataset is quite comeples, we spent lots of time exploring the data and familiarizing ourselves with relevant concepts. We also spent time on improving storytelling. Once the storyline is clear, the implementation went relatively smoothly. It took us approximately 18 people-hours to get to the MVP, and an additional 40 hours to finish the final.
